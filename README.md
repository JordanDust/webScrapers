# webScraper
A simple web scrapper program created by Liam Bee and Jason Mele for the 5th Learning Module of Mr. Detrick's Honors Advanded Topics in Computer Science class at Warren Hills Regional High School. 

There are 3 main programs, the web scrapper itself and the GUI program and website, which allow you to search for either a stock or another purchasable item and see both current and historical data.
